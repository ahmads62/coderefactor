# Horiseon-code-refactor Assignment

## Description
    The challenge is to take existing code and refactor it (recall that to refactor code is to improve it without changing what it does) to meet a certain set of standards or implement a new technology. In this Challenge, a marketing agency has hired you to refactor an existing site to make it more accessible.

## User Story
    AS A marketing agency I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines

## AC
    GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
    WHEN I view the source code
    THEN I find semantic HTML elements
    WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
    THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
    WHEN I view the image elements
    THEN I find accessible alt attributes
    WHEN I view the heading attributes
    THEN they fall in sequential order
    WHEN I view the title element
    THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
    
### Tasks Accomplished 
    1 Redundant classes were removed and consolidated
    2 <div> HTML elements were replaced with semantic HTML elements
    3 Alt text was added to images
    4 Comments added in the HTML 
    5 CSS organised and comments added to improve readibility 
    6 A descriptive title was added
